# ELOG+
## Overview

Welcome to the Log Entry Microservice documentation. This Java-based microservice provides a robust 
platform for managing log entries, logbooks, and offers secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Features

The Log Entry Microservice offers the following key features:

- **Log Entry Management**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete log entries.
- **Logbook Support**: Log entries can belong to one or more logbooks.
- **Tagging**: Logbooks can define tags for categorizing log entries.
- **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in with varying levels of access (read, write, admin) on specific logbooks.
    - Application Token Authentication: Secure access for applications with generated tokens.

## Getting Started

The Log Entry Microservice is a Java backend application designed to manage log entries. Each log 
entry can belong to one or more logbooks, and each logbook can define one or more tags to categorize 
and specify the log entries. The application supports user or application token authentication and 
authorization for securing access. Additionally, it provides fine-grained access control, allowing 
users to have read, write, and admin authorization on each logbook.

### Scalability

Scalability is a critical aspect on modern Microservices architecture, the new ELOGs uses stateless REST api 
allowing to have more than one instance that run into modern orchestrator. This help to increase the number of
http request that can be processed.


### Prerequisites

ELOG+ run on java virtual machine version 19+. It uses Spring Boot Framework 3.x

## JWT Application token key
the ***app-token-jwt-key*** properties can be filled using the openssl tools like shown below
```shell
openssl rand -hex <size> 
```

## Scalability

Scalability is a critical aspect of the Log Entry Microservice, as it allows the application to handle increased loads and growing data volumes. Here are some considerations and strategies for ensuring scalability:

### 1. Microservices Architecture

The Log Entry Microservice is designed with a microservices architecture in mind. This approach allows you to break down the application into smaller, independent services, each responsible for a specific function. This modularity makes it easier to scale individual components as needed.

### 2. Load Balancing

Implement load balancing to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple instances of the microservice. This ensures that no single instance becomes a bottleneck and improves overall system performance and availability.

### 3. Horizontal Scaling

One of the key advantages of microservices is the ability to horizontally scale individual services. You can add more instances of a service to the application cluster as the load increases. Container orchestration tools like Kubernetes can help manage and automate this process.

### 4. Caching

Consider implementing caching mechanisms to reduce the load on your database and improve response times. Cache frequently accessed data, such as log entries or frequently used metadata, using solutions like Redis or Memcached.

### 5. Asynchronous Processing

For tasks that can be performed asynchronously, such as log entry processing, consider using message queues or event-driven architecture. This allows the microservice to handle a high volume of requests without blocking the main application thread.

### 6. Database Sharding

As your data grows, consider database sharding to distribute the data across multiple database instances or partitions. This horizontal partitioning can improve database performance and scalability.

### 7. Monitoring and Auto-Scaling

Implement monitoring tools to keep track of system performance and resource utilization. Set up auto-scaling rules to automatically add or remove instances based on predefined metrics, such as CPU usage or request rate.

### 8. Stateless Services

Design your microservices to be stateless whenever possible. Storing session state externally, using technologies like JWT tokens, allows you to scale services more easily since any instance can handle a request without relying on local state.

## Deployment for Scalability

When deploying the Log Entry Microservice for scalability, consider using cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, which provide scalable infrastructure options, including managed container services and serverless computing.

Additionally, document your deployment strategies and best practices for scaling in the [Deployment Guide](deployment-guide.md).

## Security Considerations

Please ensure that you follow security best practices when scaling the microservice in production. Implement measures such as HTTPS, proper access controls, and data encryption to protect sensitive information, especially when dealing with multiple instances and distributed services.
